After more than an year studying to become a front end developer
with the assistance of my good friends Gabriel Franco and Jansen Moreira
I learned about The Odin Project while playing World of Warcraft and now
here I am, re doing all the fundamentals and learning a few new things
on the way like how to do propper commits and work with Ubuntu for instance.

My goal is to become part of TOP's comunity and to become a fullstack
developer by the end of this part of my journey.
